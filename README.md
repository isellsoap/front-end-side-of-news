# The front-end side of news

Front-end metrics from big news sites around the world. https://isellsoap.github.io/front-end-side-of-news/

## Motivation

On March 30th 2015 [I tweeted an image](https://twitter.com/isellsoap/status/582456573139804160) of a weekend project I did showing a chart of HTTP requests and page weights of big news sites from various countries. I got a lot of feedback from that tweet (at least for my standards). [Anselm Hannemann asked](https://twitter.com/helloanselm/status/582457282111356928) if I would put up a HTML version of the image, so this is it.

I think especially big news sites have a certain responsibility of delivering a certain quality of front-end code to their customers because they normally have **massive reach**, **massive traffic**, **loyal readers** and are confronted with a **heterogenous pallet of end-user devices** they have to serve. Last but not least they offer **information people want to consume** if they visit their site, so the information should be served as **fast** and **accessible** as possible.
